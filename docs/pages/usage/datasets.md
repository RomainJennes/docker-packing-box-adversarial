# Datasets

*Datasets* are folders holding samples to be analyzed. They aim to organize input executables according to a [strict structure](#structure), including packing labels, original names, and so forth.

## Structure

A (normal) dataset folder holds the following files/folders:

```
[name]
  +-- files
  |     +-- {executables, renamed to their SHA256 hashes}
  +-- data.csv          # metadata and labels of the executable
  +-- metadata.json     # simple statistics about the dataset
```

A fileless dataset has the following structure:

```
[name]
  +-- data.csv          # metadata and labels of the executable
  +-- features.json     # dictionary of selected features and their descriptions
  +-- metadata.json     # simple statistics about the dataset
```

Fileless datasets can be used when we are sure of the features set to be computed. It can also save substantial disk space (such a dataset will at most take a few megabytes of data while the executables from the original one could occupy gigabytes).

## Tool

A [dedicated tool](https://github.com/dhondta/docker-packing-box/blob/main/files/tools/dataset) called `dataset` is provided with the [*Packing Box*](https://github.com/dhondta/docker-packing-box) to manipulate datasets. Its help message tells everything the user needs to get started.

```session
$ dataset --help

[...]
```

## Visualization

The list of datasets in a folder can be viewed by using the command `dataset list [folder]` (`dataset list` will display all the datasets in the current folder).

Among the other commands, we can `show` the metadata of the dataset for describing it, limiting the number of displayed records if required (`-l`/`--limit` ; default is 10 records) and/or sorting the metadata per category (`-c`/`--categories`).

```session
# dataset show test

```

While the `show` command displays information about a dataset, it is not aimed to filter and observe records according to criteria. This can be done by using the `view` command which uses [Pandas' query method](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.query.html) through the `--query` option.

## Manipulation

The rest of the other commands are aimed to manipulate datasets in different ways. The most trivial commands are:

- `purge`: this trivial command purges the target dataset of all its records and files.
- `rename`: this other trivial command renames the target dataset ; it differs from a simple '`mv [...]`' in that it also adapts backup copies of the dataset.

For adding/removing executables to/from the dataset, a few commands are available:

- `make`: this adds a given number (`-n`/`--number-excutables`) of new executables to the dataset, eventually only from some given categories (`-c`/`--categories`), randomly packing some of them such that the dataset is balanced (using the `-b`/`--balance` option will balance between packer labels, not simply between packed and not packed) and with every applicable packer or only the given ones (`-p`/`--packer`).
- `merge`: this merges the second input dataset into the first one.
- `remove`: this allows to remove executables from the dataset according to criteria relying on [Pandas' query method](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.query.html) through the `--query` option.
- `select`: this creates a new dataset with a selected subset of the target dataset, using criteria relying on [Pandas' query method](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.query.html) through the `--query` option.
- `update`: this updates the current dataset with executables from the target folders (`-s`/`--source-dir`), either packed or not, labelling them with an input JSON (`-l`/`--labels`) or enabling detection with the integrated detectors (`-d`/`--detect`).

It is also possible to apply corrective/evolutive measures on a dataset:

- `convert`: this makes possible to convert a dataset with files (which offers the possibility to select features multiple times from the same dataset) to a dataset without files (that is, with its features computed once and for all, not keeping the related files and then possibly saving a large amount of disk space).
- `fix`: this allows to fix a corrupted dataset, especially when JSON files do not match the content of the `files` folder anymore, which can be fixed either by relying on the content of this folder (with the `-f`/`--files` option) or on hashes contained in the labels JSON, eventually applying detection (`-d`/`--detect`) to fix labels.
- `revert`: this allows to revert the dataset to its state before the previous operation, with a maximum of 3
